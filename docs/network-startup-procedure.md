# Deploy Network

The Network boots with a Master of Ceremonies,
it is a special Node that does not require a Stake on it.
Once the first Node becomes staked and available, the control of the network will 
get passed to this Node.

A Bootstrap Account holds all funds after booting the network.

# Claiming Contract

The claiming contract is not part of the chain spec.
It needs to get deployed using the EOA Bootstrap account.
The Owner of the Bootstrap account also has the responsibility to fill the claiming contract.

# Filling the Delta Pot

Once sufficient time has passed,
the Bootstrap account has to fill the Delta Pot.
